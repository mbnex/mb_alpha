## 1) What?

Json schemas have been written from Gemini Experimental 1206 LLM Model using Google AI Studio individually, analyzing the way 'successful' app manage objects between users and databases. Each JSON Schema is in its own file in the /schemas/ directory, using the filename convention of app.schema.$_APPNAME.json

## Objective

The idea of this task is merge the lexicon/ontology/class object of many/most popular web/network applications to condense/convert/merge into a unified schema. This is a more diligent approach to creating a unified schema, and will be used in comparison to the existing superapp schema queries.

### Merged JSON

Merging JSON of 69+ different schema objects could be done with JSON merging tools, but the individual JSON Objects can be analyzed as a text blob without having to worry about valid JSON and loss vs. lossy merging concepts.

#### Application List
