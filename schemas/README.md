## 1) What?

Json schemas have been written from Gemini Experimental 1206 LLM Model using Google AI Studio individually, analyzing the way 'successful' app manage objects between users and databases. Each JSON Schema is in its own file in the /schemas/ directory, using the filename convention of app.schema.$_APPNAME.json

## Objective

The idea of this task is merge the lexicon/ontology/class object of many/most popular web/network applications to condense/convert/merge into a unified schema. This is a more diligent approach to creating a unified schema, and will be used in comparison to the existing superapp schema queries.

### Merged JSON

Merging JSON of 69+ different schema objects could be done with JSON merging tools, but the individual JSON Objects can be analyzed as a text blob without having to worry about valid JSON and loss vs. lossy merging concepts.

#### Application List

JSON Schemas have be created for the following apps:
"popular_apps":
["TikTok",
"Facebook",
"LinkedIn",
"Twitter (Jack)",
"X (Elon)",

### Gemini Prompt

create a unified json schema from the following schemas below. they are in no particular order or priority. do not simply repeat the content; discover missing
superclasses that more flexibly express the data for general adaptivity.  eliminate redundancy. prefer the common and concise identifiers. ignore any implementation-specific details in the schemas that would not apply to something else: such as: error codes,.response or api  codes  for any object Id properties, use uuid (string), not numbers. write the schema, do not bother explaining anything.  The goal is to create a unified schema. Focus on what these these schemas enable and express, rather than any particular details about the apps/sites themselves


#### Final unified schema 

original unified schema is called "unified_schema.json" in this directory
final unified schema (after targeted modelling) is "unified_schema2.json""
